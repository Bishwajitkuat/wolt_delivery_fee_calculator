# Delivery Fee Calculator

## I have completed the Frontend (React + TS) task

This app takes user inputs and return delivery price. I have used Vite to innitiate the React project with TS. Tailwindcss is used to style the app. I have used Zod to validate user inputs and it is helpfull to give elaborate and customized error message for worng input types in combination with react-hookform and hookform/resolvers. Finally, Vitest is used for testing the Calculator component and feeCalculator function.
