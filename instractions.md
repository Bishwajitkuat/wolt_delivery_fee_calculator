## Delivery Fee Calculator

The goal of the assignment is to showcase your coding skills and ability to develop features. This is a highly important part of the hiring process so it's crucial to put effort into this without making it too bloated. Reviewers will put weight on three main aspects: code quality, maintainability, and testing. Based on the results of the assignment review, we will make the decision on proceeding to the technical interview.

Your task is to write a delivery fee calculator. This code is needed when a customer is ready with their shopping cart and weâ€™d like to show them how much the delivery will cost. The delivery price depends on the cart value, the number of items in the cart, the time of the order, and the delivery distance.

### Specification

Rules for calculating a delivery fee

- If the cart value is less than 10â‚¬, a small order surcharge is added to the delivery price. The surcharge is the difference between the cart value and 10â‚¬. For example if the cart value is 8.90â‚¬, the surcharge will be 1.10â‚¬.

- A delivery fee for the first 1000 meters (=1km) is 2â‚¬. If the delivery distance is longer than that, 1â‚¬ is added for every additional 500 meters that the courier needs to travel before reaching the destination. Even if the distance would be shorter than 500 meters, the minimum fee is always 1â‚¬.
  - Example 1: If the delivery distance is 1499 meters, the delivery fee is: 2â‚¬ base fee + 1â‚¬ for the additional 500 m => 3â‚¬
  - Example 2: If the delivery distance is 1500 meters, the delivery fee is: 2â‚¬ base fee + 1â‚¬ for the additional 500 m => 3â‚¬
  - Example 3: If the delivery distance is 1501 meters, the delivery fee is: 2â‚¬ base fee + 1â‚¬ for the first 500 m + 1â‚¬ for the second 500 m => 4â‚¬
- If the number of items is five or more, an additional 50 cent surcharge is added for each item above and including the fifth item. An extra "bulk" fee applies for more than 12 items of 1,20â‚¬

  - Example 1: If the number of items is 4, no extra surcharge
  - Example 2: If the number of items is 5, 50 cents surcharge is added
  - Example 3: If the number of items is 10, 3â‚¬ surcharge (6 x 50 cents) is added
  - Example 4: If the number of items is 13, 5,70â‚¬ surcharge is added ((9 \* 50 cents) + 1,20â‚¬)
  - Example 5: If the number of items is 14, 6,20â‚¬ surcharge is added ((10 \* 50 cents) + 1,20â‚¬)

- The delivery fee can **never** be more than 15â‚¬, including possible surcharges.

- The delivery is free (0â‚¬) when the cart value is equal or more than 200â‚¬.

- During the Friday rush, 3 - 7 PM, the delivery fee (the total fee including possible surcharges) will be multiplied by 1.2x. However, the fee still cannot be more than the max (15â‚¬). Considering timezone, for simplicity, **use UTC as a timezone in backend solutions** (so Friday rush is 3 - 7 PM UTC). **In frontend solutions, use the timezone of the browser** (so Friday rush is 3 - 7 PM in the timezone of the browser).

### Expectations

When reviewing your code, we will focus on the part that fulfils the requirements explained above. We would love to see a well-tested and readable solution.

Pro tip: When you think you are ready with the assignment, take at least a few hours break, and then go through the code one more time before returning it.

### Submitting the assignment

Bundle everything into a Zip archive and upload it to Google Drive, Dropbox or similar and include the link in the application. Remember to check permissions! If we cannot access the file, we cannot review your code. Please donâ€™t store your solution in a public GitHub repository during the application period.

A good check before sending your task is to unzip the Zip archive into a new folder and check that building and running the project works, using the steps you define in readme.md. Forgotten dependencies and instructions can sometimes happen even to the best of us.
